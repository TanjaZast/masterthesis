        \footnotesize{This master thesis investigates the usability of data sets from the Apple Watch Ultra in the context of the 6-Minute Walk Test using machine learning techniques. The aim of the study is to evaluate the reliability and applicability of data from wearable technologies, focusing exclusively on the Apple Watch Ultra. By integrating additional health metrics such as body mass index, blood pressure and demographic variables, the predictive power of ML models in predicting health outcomes and detecting potential risks will be investigated.
        
        Key contributions include the application of various machine learning models, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, to analyze heart rate, energy expenditure and distance walked recorded during the 6-Minute Walk Test. The study highlights the importance of comprehensive data analysis and the potential of the Apple Watch Ultra. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning methods in improving the accuracy of health predictions and provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of using Apple Watch Ultra data for specific applications. 

        The complete code and all programmed models used in this study can be accessed in the GitHub repository ~\cite{githubMasterthesisjupyter_folderMain}.
