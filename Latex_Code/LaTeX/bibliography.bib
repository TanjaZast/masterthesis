With vast amounts of medical data being generated, there is an urgent need to effectively use this data to benefit the medical and health care sectors all across the world. This survey paper presents a systematic literature review for the investigation of various machine learning techniques used for numerous medical applications which are published in highly reputable venues in recent years. Considering only the recent work, we are able to survey the current machine learning and deep learning models that are being used for medical data. This literature review identifies a clear shift of artificial intelligence techniques used in the medical domain, with deep learning methods taking precedence over machine learning methods.}
